# Data Scientist Career Path


There are a lot of resources about how to start out as a data scientist. 
A lot of **Towards Data Science** or **Medium** are "here is why algorithm X is great" or "5 functions in Python you have to master".

A blog (Stacked Turtles)[https://kiwidamien.github.io] aims to build intermediate _technical_ skills of a data scientist.
e.g. how to deal with confounders, how to evaluate the impact of your work.

This blog (and it willl eventually be a blog in sphinx!) will be focused on career advice, particularly how to get from being hired as a data scientist to move forward. It is less focused (not at all focused?) on how to get started as a data scientist, as that material is covered in detail elsewhere

## Building instructions

To run on your local machine
```python
make serve
```
This will compile the HTML, and you should be able to access the documentation on `localhost:8990`

To deploy, `make github` and then push to generated docs to the main branch.
